Seance Implementation
=====================

Seance is a new communications protocol meant to be easy to setup and use
initially, while being very extensible to add new functionality in the future.

Some of the new-wave functionality is to allow extension negotiation to happen
at times other than the initial handshake, and even to allow new extensions to
be negotiated on the fly; regardless of previously negotiating extensions.

Other goals include being able to set up semi-persistent sessions which can be
disconnected and rejoined without having to deal with stateless servers.

Twitch?

Yeah, they have a programming section and everything, so I figured I'd lend
some knowledge to programming broadcasts that take the form of a video
tutorial. In the broadcasts I go through what I am creating, why I am making
the decisions I am (and programming the items in a given way) as well as some
of the common pit falls that people just starting out run in to.

If you are interested in viewing a broadcast at some point, feel free to drop
